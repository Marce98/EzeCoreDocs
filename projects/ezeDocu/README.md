# EzeCore Development Standards

## Overview
This documentation contains **recommended standards** for development within the EzeCore ecosystem. These standards ensure consistency, scalability, and maintainability across all platforms and applications.

> **Note**: These are general guidelines that apply to new development. Projects may have specific requirements that necessitate variations from these standards. Any variations should be documented within the respective project/feature documentation.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Standards (Recommended)
1. **[AWS Resource Naming Standards](./standards/01-aws-naming-standards.md)**
   - Naming conventions for all AWS resources
   - Prefix requirements for common and app-specific resources

2. **[DynamoDB Design Patterns](./standards/02-dynamodb-patterns.md)**
   - Single table design approach
   - Entity modeling and access patterns
   - Partition and sort key strategies

3. **[Architecture Principles](./standards/03-architecture-principles.md)**
   - Prototype-first development
   - Cost optimization strategies
   - Simplicity over complexity

4. **[Multi-Tenancy Standards](./standards/04-multi-tenancy.md)**
   - Platform, Company, and Location hierarchies
   - Data isolation and access control
   - Tenant identification patterns

5. **[Resource Tagging Standards](./standards/05-tagging-standards.md)**
   - Recommended tags for AWS resources
   - Tag naming conventions
   - Tracking and organization best practices

6. **[Authentication Standards](./standards/06-authentication.md)**
   - AWS Cognito implementation
   - User pool configurations
   - Identity federation guidelines

### Templates
- **[Exception Documentation Template](./templates/exception-template.md)** - Use this when deviating from standards

### Examples
- Sample implementations and use cases
- Reference architectures
- Code snippets

## Quick Reference

### Resource Naming Guide
- **Common Resources**: `EzeCore-[Category]-[ResourceName]`
- **App-Specific**: `[appname]-[Category]-[ResourceName]`

### Key Principles
1. **Multi-platform, Multi-tenant, Multi-location** architecture
2. **AWS Cognito** for authentication (preferred)
3. **DynamoDB single table** design where applicable
4. **On-demand, minimalistic** resource provisioning
5. **No fallback mechanisms** unless explicitly required

## Implementation Guidelines
- New projects should follow these standards as baseline
- Deviations are acceptable when:
  1. Technical requirements demand it
  2. Cost-benefit analysis justifies variation
  3. Properly documented in project documentation
  4. Team consensus is achieved

## Getting Started
1. Review core standards documents
2. Adapt templates to project needs
3. Document any project-specific variations
4. Share learnings with the team

## Maintenance
These standards are living documents and will be updated based on:
- Lessons learned from production
- AWS service updates
- Team feedback and retrospectives
- Industry best practices
