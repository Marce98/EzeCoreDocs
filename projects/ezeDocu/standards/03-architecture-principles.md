# Architecture Principles

## Overview
Our architecture philosophy prioritizes simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and rapid iteration. We build prototypes first, validate assumptions, then scale based on actual needs rather than anticipated requirements.

## Core Principles

### 1. Prototype-First Development
**Start simple, iterate based on real usage**

- Begin with minimal viable architecture
- Use serverless and managed services
- Validate business logic before optimizing
- Measure actual usage patterns before scaling

**Example Progression**:
1. **Prototype**: Lambda + DynamoDB on-demand
2. **Validated**: Add API Gateway, basic monitoring
3. **Production**: Add caching, provisioned capacity
4. **Scale**: Multi-region, advanced monitoring

### 2. Cost Optimization First
**Every architectural decision must consider cost**

#### Use On-Demand/Serverless
- **Lambda**: Pay only for execution time
- **DynamoDB**: On-demand billing for unpredictable workloads
- **API Gateway**: Pay per request
- **S3**: Pay for storage used

#### Minimize Fixed Costs
- Avoid EC2 instances in prototype phase
- No NAT Gateways unless absolutely required
- Use S3 for static content, not EC2/ECS
- Leverage free tiers during development

#### Right-Sizing Strategy
```
Prototype → Measure → Optimize → Scale
```

### 3. Simplicity Over Complexity
**If you can't explain it simply, it's too complex**

#### Avoid Premature Optimization
- No microservices for simple applications
- No Kubernetes for basic workloads
- No custom frameworks when AWS services suffice
- No multi-region unless required by law/SLA

#### Progressive Enhancement
- Single Lambda function → Multiple functions → Step Functions
- Single DynamoDB table → GSIs → Multiple tables
- Direct integration → API Gateway → Load balancer

### 4. No Unnecessary Resilience
**Build resilience based on actual SLA requirements**

#### Default Approach
- **No fallback mechanisms** unless explicitly required
- **No migration tools** until migration is needed
- **No disaster recovery** beyond AWS's built-in redundancy
- **No multi-AZ** for development/prototype

#### When to Add Resilience
- Customer-facing production systems
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Documented SLA commitments
- Proven high-value transactions

## Architectural Patterns

### Compute Strategy

#### Serverless First
```
Priority Order:
1. Lambda (stateless compute)
2. Fargate (containerized workloads)
3. ECS on EC2 (specific requirements)
4. EC2 (legacy or special needs)
```

### Storage Strategy

#### Data Storage Hierarchy
```
1. DynamoDB - Primary operational data
2. S3 - Files, backups, archives
3. RDS - Only when relational is mandatory
4. ElastiCache - Only after proving need
```

### Integration Patterns

#### API Design
- REST over GraphQL for simplicity
- Direct service integration when possible
- API Gateway for public endpoints
- Lambda function URLs for internal APIs

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- Use only when asynchronous processing benefits outweigh complexity
- EventBridge for AWS service events
- SQS for simple queuing
- SNS for fan-out patterns

## Development Workflow

### 1. Prototype Phase
```yaml
Resources:
  - Lambda: On-demand, minimal memory
  - DynamoDB: On-demand billing
  - API Gateway: Basic setup
  - Monitoring: CloudWatch basics only
  - Security: IAM roles, basic policies
```

### 2. Validation Phase
```yaml
Added:
  - Basic error handling
  - Simple logging
  - Performance metrics
  - Cost tracking
```

### 3. Production Phase
```yaml
Considered (if justified):
  - Auto-scaling
  - Enhanced monitoring
  - Caching layers
  - Backup strategies
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Over-Engineering
❌ **Don't**:
- Build for millions of users on day one
- Implement complex caching without metrics
- Create elaborate CI/CD for simple projects
- Design for problems you don't have

✅ **Do**:
- Build for current load + 2x
- Add caching after identifying bottlenecks
- Use simple deployment scripts initially
- Solve problems you actually face

### Premature Abstraction
❌ **Don't**:
- Create shared libraries too early
- Build generic platforms
- Abstract everything "just in case"

✅ **Do**:
- Copy code until patterns emerge
- Build specific solutions first
- Extract abstractions from working code

## Technology Selection

### Authentication
**Default**: AWS Cognito
- User pools for user management
- Identity pools for AWS resource access
- Social login integration when needed

**Exceptions**:
- Auth0/Okta for enterprise SSO requirements
- Custom only for specific regulatory needs

### Monitoring & Observability
**Start With**:
- CloudWatch Logs
- CloudWatch Metrics
- X-Ray for critical paths only

**Add When Proven Necessary**:
- DataDog/New Relic
- ELK Stack
- Custom dashboards

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure as Code
- CloudFormation for AWS resources
- Simple, readable templates
- No complex nested stacks initially
- Parameter files for environment configs

### Environment Strategy
```
Development → Staging → Production
```
- Dev: Minimal resources, on-demand
- Staging: Production-like, reduced capacity
- Production: Full capacity, monitoring

## Security Baseline

### Minimum Requirements
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Secrets in Parameter Store/Secrets Manager
- HTTPS for all endpoints
- VPC only when required

### Progressive Security
1. Basic IAM policies
2. API keys for rate limiting
3. WAF for public endpoints (when needed)
4. VPC + Private subnets (if justified)

## Decision Framework

### When to Add Complexity
Ask these questions before adding any architectural component:

1. **Is there a proven need?** (metrics, user feedback)
2. **What's the cost impact?** (development + operational)
3. **Can we solve it simpler?** (existing AWS service)
4. **Is it reversible?** (can we remove it easily)
5. **Does it align with our timeline?** (prototype vs production)

### Documentation Requirements
When deviating from these principles:
1. Document the specific requirement
2. Show cost-benefit analysis
3. Define success metrics
4. Plan removal strategy

## Evolution Path
```mermaid
Prototype → Measure → Optimize → Scale → Measure → Optimize
    ↑                                                    ↓
    ←───────────────── Simplify ←────────────────────←
```

Remember: **The best architecture is the simplest one that solves your actual problems.**
